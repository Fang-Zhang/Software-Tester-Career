# ISTQB Framework

## Core Foundation
### ISTQB-CTFL(ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level)
- Fundamentals of Testing
  - What is Testing?
  - Why is Testing Necessary?
  - Seven Testing Principles
    - Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence
    - Exhaustive testing is impossible
    - Early testing saves time and money
    - Defects cluster together
    - Beware of the pesticide paradox
    - Testing is context dependent
    - Absence-of-errors is a fallacy
  - Test Activities, Testware and Test Roles
  - Essential Skills and Good Practice for Testing
    - Plan the testing SMART(Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound)
    - Integrate testing in the development stage("shift-left":test early and often, TDD, BDD, Agile)
  ![Shift-Left](./../99-Resources/SDLC-V-Model.png)
    - Use test-oriented development practices(Pair Programming, TDD, CI/CD)
    - Adequate reporting of testing progress and results
    - Comprehensive testing coverage
    - Test on real devices
    - Testing metrics practice(Process metrics, Product metrics, Project metrics)
  ![Test-Metrics](./../99-Resources/Test-Metrics.png)
    - Distributing tasks according to the team members' skills
    - Testing one feature per case
    - Provide Version-Call(Rollback) option
