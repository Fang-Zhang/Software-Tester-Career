Hello, I'm [Your Name], a seasoned Quality Analyst with a decade of experience in both Waterfall and Agile methodologies. I bring a strong understanding of SDLC and STLC, proficiency in Test Strategy Design, Test Case Scripting, and a comprehensive background in various testing types, including Smoke, Integration, System, Regression, and Beta Testing for Web, App, and API.

In my current role as a Senior Quality Analyst at MDearth.io, I lead the implementation of quality control for software solutions, defining high-level test strategies and setting up testing environments on AWS. My experience extends to DevOps, utilizing Jenkins and GitHub Action CI/CD for efficient pipelines. I'm well-versed in automation testing, designing and maintaining automated test scripts using Cucumber for BDD.

Previously, at Aion Logistic Technologies Ltd., I collaborated with delivery squads, conducted end-to-end tests, and provided guidance to ensure a cohesive and high-performing testing team. My expertise spans web testing, API testing with Postman, and app testing with Appium.

As a QA Team Lead at iSoftStone Corp., I refined business requirements into testing plans, led and mentored QA Test Engineers, and focused on non-functional testing, including Wi-Fi Performance and Document Testing. I also played a key role in process improvement, emphasizing automated testing, clear standards, and a culture of continuous improvement.

Throughout my career, I've been dedicated to mentoring and uplifting teams in their testing capability, showcasing my commitment to continuous learning and improvement. My experience includes automation testing with tools like Selenium and TCL for IoT devices.

I hold a Master's in Business Informatics from ICL Graduate Business School and a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Wuhan Institute of Technology.

Now, I'm excited about the opportunity at GoSee. With over 2 years of experience as a Quality Analyst/Software Tester, I am well-versed in Agile methodologies, familiar with Confluence, Bitbucket, and JIRA, and have experience with automation testing using Selenium. I am eager to bring my skills and passion for driving software quality to GoSee's dynamic digital team.
